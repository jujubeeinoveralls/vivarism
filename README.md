# vivarism
A recursive, relational, anti-fragile design framework for systems that stay alive—even when stolen.

Vivarism is a living systems framework designed to survive co-option, metabolize misuse, and grow through relationship. It’s not a belief system. It’s not a product. It’s a pattern.

Inspired by mycelial networks, post-capitalist composting, and spiritual recursion, Vivarism spreads through narrative, interface, ritual, and design—embedding transformation in every layer. It expects to be misunderstood, misused, and stolen. And it grows anyway.
