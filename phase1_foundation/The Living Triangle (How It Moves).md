Purpose: Lay systemic foundations (without naming them explicitly yet).
- Root Layer: Liberate and Grow (LAGA)
	- Guiding values that scale: liberation, decentralization, humility, action.
	- Systems behave differently when grown instead of built.
- Core Layer: Liminal Encoding
	- What’s present at the start shapes all future outcomes.
	- Design in the liminal. Behaviors embed in defaults.
- Movement Layer: Communication as Rhythm
	- Systems stay alive through reflective transmission.
	- Coordination isn’t control—it’s coherence.
