## II. [[THE SEED. WHAT IS VIVARISM]]

Purpose: Root the reader in systemic emergence.
•	Vivarism is not a belief system—it is a living one.
•	It is a way of tending, of coding, of relating.
•	Vivarism doesn’t resist co-option. It prepares for it.
	•	Trojan seeding: what’s stolen gets transformed.
	•	Indigestible insight encoded in form.
