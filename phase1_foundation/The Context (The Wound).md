# 🌍 The Context (The Wound)

## 💔 Purpose: Show why Vivarism was needed.

- 🔄 [[The Era of Co-option]]
	- How liberation movements get absorbed, sanitized, sold.
	- Examples: DEI → HR initiative, Pride → corporate marketing, mindfulness → productivity tool.
- 🧠 [[Spirituality as a Tool of Abuse]]
	- From cult dynamics to guru culture.
	- Trauma-bypassing, aesthetic spirituality, spiritual capitalism.
- 🌐 [[Neo-Colonial Echoes]]
	- Systems that pretend to be post-oppression but are re-skinned control.
	- Language of inclusion without structural change.
- ⚫ [[The Void]]
	- What happens when frameworks get hollowed.
	- The need for something living.
- ✨ Enter: the first murmur of Vivarism.
