Purpose: Show why Vivarism was needed.
•	[[The Era of Co-option]]
	•	How liberation movements get absorbed, sanitized, sold.
	•	Examples: DEI → HR initiative, Pride → corporate marketing, mindfulness → productivity tool.
•	[[Spirituality as a Tool of Abuse]]
	•	From cult dynamics to guru culture.
	•	Trauma-bypassing, aesthetic spirituality, spiritual capitalism.
•	[[Neo-Colonial Echoes]]
	•	Systems that pretend to be post-oppression but are re-skinned control.
	•	Language of inclusion without structural change.
•	[[The Void]]
	•	What happens when frameworks get hollowed.
	•	The need for something living.
•	Enter: the first murmur of Vivarism.
