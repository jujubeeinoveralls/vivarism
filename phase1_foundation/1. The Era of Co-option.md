## The Devouring of Liberation: How Movements Live and Die in the Belly of Power

All living movements begin at the wild edges. They are born as defiant sparks in the night – untamed, unapologetic, and alive. In those first moments, liberation movements speak with the raw voice of the marginalized, a voice the dominant systems cannot yet fully hear or understand. But power has a way of listening eventually, not to understand, but to absorb and pacify. What starts as a flame in the darkness is gradually domesticated into a lantern in the halls of the status quo. The pattern is hauntingly familiar: marginalization, then selective engagement, then aesthetic adoption, then commercial extraction, and finally institutional incorporation. In this chapter, we trace that pattern – the co-option and hollowing of liberation – through real histories and living examples. We move with poetic eyes through each phase of the absorption pattern, watching how Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, Pride marches, and even spiritual Mindfulness practices are devoured and repackaged. This is a story told not in detached analysis but in the throbbing, metaphor-rich language of Vivarism – one living system speaking to another. It is a manifesto of warning and of hope, a recognition of how the soul of liberation can be both stolen and saved.

## Marginalization: Seeds in the Cracks of Empire

Every liberatory idea begins as a small seed pushing up through cracks in the empire’s pavement. At first, the dominant order meets it with indifference or brute force. Marginalization is the stage of exile and ridicule, where the movement’s truth is kept at the periphery of society – sometimes literally outlawed, sometimes simply ignored. Picture it: a humid night in June 1969, New York City – police raid a little bar called Stonewall Inn, and for the first time the patrons, drag queens and street kids, gay and trans folk who have been harassed a thousand times before, say “no more.” They erupt in resistance, hurling bottles and bricks, forcing the police to retreat. The uprising lasts six days ￼ ￼. Pride, now famous as a celebration, was born as a riot in the margins, an illegal and spontaneous cry for dignity. In that moment, the LGBTQ+ liberation movement was wild and untamed, considered perverse and dangerous by the institutions of its day. The very next morning, newspapers and politicians dismissed and demonized the rioters – a common ritual of marginalization. Another scene: an African American employee in the 1960s stands up in a company meeting to question why no people of color or women are in leadership. He is labeled “troublemaker,” perhaps finds his career quietly stalled or his concerns laughed off as impolite. The early calls for diversity and equity in workplaces – be it hiring black managers or paying women equal wages – were relegated to whispers and side conversations. To demand justice openly was to invite retaliation. And elsewhere, on a quieter plane, imagine a young Vietnamese Zen monk in the 1970s teaching mindfulness and peace in war-torn villages, or a handful of Americans in the early 1980s learning meditation at a Buddhist center. To the wider society, they are curiosities at best, cultists at worst. A mindful path of spiritual liberation is seen as foreign mysticism, marginal and suspect. These are the seeds in the cracks: ideas and practices of liberation living at the edges of a hostile concrete world.

In the marginalization phase, the language of the movement is raw and true. It has not yet been appropriated – in fact it may be brutally suppressed. The world at large has not adopted its slogans or symbols; those belong only to the brave few who carry them. The powers that be use outright repression or ridicule. DEI was once simply the fight against discrimination, born from civil rights and feminist movements, led by activists and workers on the streets demanding to be treated as human. Pride was once an underground network of gay and trans folk protecting each other from violence, gathering in secret, their flags and handshakes invisible to a hostile public. Mindfulness was once inseparable from its spiritual and ethical roots – a practice of liberation from suffering taught in sanghas and ashrams, far removed from boardrooms and wellness apps. In these early days, authenticity is not in question – it is all there is. But authenticity lives a fragile life. The young movement is like a vulnerable organism in an environment full of predators. And so the story proceeds: as the seed grows and shows signs of strength, the dominant system – the empire – takes notice and prepares to do what empires do best: domesticate what it cannot destroy.

## Selective Engagement: The Lure of Legitimacy

Eventually, the new movement shows it will not simply wither away; its vitality is too strong to snuff out at the margins. So the system changes tactics. It extends one hand in welcome while the other still grips a knife behind its back. Selective engagement is this two-faced moment: power decides to engage some part of the movement, the part it finds useful or least threatening, while continuing to reject or marginalize the rest. This is a cunning phase – a little bit of validation is offered, a taste of legitimacy to lure the movement closer, to tame its wildness.

In the wake of Stonewall, for example, some city officials and mainstream gay rights leaders began to allow carefully managed displays of Pride. A year after the riots, on the anniversary, there was a Christopher Street Liberation Day march – what we now recognize as the first Pride parade ￼. But even as Pride marches became annual events, fissures appeared. Only a few years later, in 1973, the organizers of New York’s Pride march banned drag queens – including Stonewall veterans like Marsha P. Johnson – from participating, fearing that visible gender-nonconforming people would harm the movement’s respectability ￼. The very people who ignited the movement were being pushed aside to make Pride more palatable to the mainstream. Johnson and her trans sister-in-arms Sylvia Rivera famously responded by marching defiantly in front of the parade anyway ￼. This is selective engagement in action: the movement’s more “acceptable” faces were welcomed in, while its radical heart – the queens, the street kids, the unapologetic militants – were told to wait outside. Power was willing to engage with an LGBTQ+ identity that was depoliticized and “presentable,” but not with the full liberatory fire that had threatened police on that riot night.

In the realm of workplace equality, a similar dynamic unfolded. By the 1970s and 1980s, many large companies, prodded by new civil rights laws and social pressure, established token programs: a diversity committee here, an equal opportunity office there. Perhaps a corporation would celebrate Black History Month with a reception, or feature one woman in a management training program. It would hire a single “Diversity Officer” and tout this as proof of progress. But these steps were tightly controlled and carefully chosen – the bare minimum to appear responsive without ceding any real power. This selective engagement often meant embracing the least controversial parts of the demands. Yes, we will recruit at historically black colleges (good for public relations), but we will not question why our executive board remains almost entirely white and male. Yes, we will host a seminar on “tolerance,” but we will not discuss raising the minimum wage or changing hiring practices. The pattern became so ingrained that a new vocabulary emerged: “the business case for diversity.” Corporate leaders reframed equity as something that wasn’t about justice or redress but about improving the bottom line – diversity not as a moral imperative but as a market advantage (“diverse teams are more creative and profitable,” they would say). In making this shift, they engaged with the concept of inclusion only insofar as it could serve their goals. It was a strategic flirtation with change that left the core of corporate power structures untouched.

And in the world of mindfulness and spirituality, selective engagement arrived through the gates of science and medicine. In 1979, a molecular biologist turned meditation teacher, Jon Kabat-Zinn, introduced Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in a U.S. hospital. He had a vision during a Zen retreat that the mindfulness practices of Buddhism could be adapted and delivered in a secular form to help patients deal with chronic pain and anxiety ￼. This was a beautiful idea – and indeed a compassionate application of mindfulness – yet to make it work, Kabat-Zinn performed a delicate excision. He stripped away overt references to Buddhist cosmology, to ethics, even to the ultimate goal of enlightenment. Mindfulness was repackaged in the neutral language of stress reduction, an 8-week course complete with measurements and certifications ￼. Hospitals and universities were now willing to engage with this ancient practice, but selectively: only as a clinical technique, divorced from its original context of spiritual liberation. The deeper inquiries – about greed, ill-will, and delusion, the critique of materialism inherent in Buddhism – were left by the wayside. Corporate leaders, too, began inviting mindfulness trainers to teach breathing exercises to frazzled employees, as long as it stayed squarely in the realm of personal wellness and productivity. A taste was offered: “You may teach people to calm their minds,” said the system, “but do not mention that the frantic mind might be a symptom of the system itself. Help us take the edge off stress, but don’t question why the stress is there.” In this way, the soul of mindfulness – its call for awakening and compassionate action – was sidelined, while its bare technique was welcomed as a useful tool.

Selective engagement is the phase of seduction and partial truth. The movement, hungry for recognition after long isolation, is tempted by the sudden interest from institutions. After years in the wilderness, that first invitation to the table of power feels validating. But it is a poisoned meal. The language of liberation begins to be translated into the language of power. Demands soften into requests; revolutionary slogans morph into corporate buzzwords. We see the early signs of language drift here – the living language of the movement is taken up by outsiders and subtly redefined. “Equality” becomes “diversity,” and then diversity becomes a commodity. “Liberation” is watered down to “inclusion.” Even “mindfulness,” once part of a phrase meaning right mindfulness in a noble eightfold path, is recast as a mere attention skill. The movement’s leaders are pressured to become professionals palatable to those in power – to wear suits instead of protest shirts, to negotiate rather than disrupt. Some activists resist this lure; others embrace it, thinking they can change the system from within. In truth, the system is already changing them. It is learning how to speak in the movement’s tongue, even as it digests only the parts it likes.

Yet something important is gained in this phase too: access. The cause steps into public consciousness in a new way. Pride marches, though tamed, become yearly fixtures, spreading to cities worldwide. Corporate diversity initiatives, however limited, put the idea of workplace equality on the agenda. Mindfulness programs in clinics and companies introduce thousands of people to meditation who might never have encountered it otherwise. This is the paradox: selective engagement opens doors even as it sets traps. The movement’s challenge is to walk through the door without losing its soul at the threshold.

## Aesthetic Adoption: Wearing the Skin Without the Soul

As the system grows comfortable with the tame version of the movement, a curious thing occurs: the aesthetic of the movement, its outward symbols and styles, get enthusiastically embraced by the mainstream. This is the phase of aesthetic adoption, where power puts on the movement’s costume and makeup, but only skin-deep. The appearance of change is celebrated, often while the substance is further diluted. The language drift now accelerates; words and symbols are copied incessantly, echoing until their original meaning fades like a photocopy of a photocopy. It is here that liberation is in greatest danger of becoming a hollow ritual – a performance devoid of the spirit that birthed it.

Look around every June in many countries: rainbows everywhere. What was once a secret code, the rainbow flag, is now a marketing department’s favorite scheme. Corporate America has made itself a part of Pride Month, eagerly slapping rainbow colors on its logos and storefronts ￼. Banks, retail giants, and tech companies sponsor pride parades; Walmart hawks Pride-themed t-shirts, and IKEA sells rainbow-hued furniture ￼. This explosion of Pride imagery is often called “rainbow capitalism.” It refers to the way capitalism appropriates LGBTQ symbols to both signal virtue and turn a profit ￼. On the surface, it looks like acceptance – what could be better than seeing once-persecuted identities affirmed on every billboard? But as queer activists have noted, all these gestures of support are not backed by real change ￼. The slogans of Pride – “Love is love,” “Equality for all” – become feel-good mantras that corporations and politicians repeat while they often ignore the continuing struggles of the LGBTQ+ community. Laws attacking transgender rights are rising, violence against trans women (especially of color) remains high, and homelessness and discrimination plague queer youth ￼. Yet the aesthetic show goes on. A professor in the PBS news aptly asked, what is behind the gesture – “what backs it up? Is there anything substantial and material…?” ￼. Too often, the answer is no. The political edge of Pride – its protest against unjust systems – gets lost amid the confetti. Pride, once a dangerous riot, has been domesticated into a parade, and now that parade is morphing into a corporate-sponsored festival. The movement’s colors and catchphrases are everywhere, but its radical demands (for systemic change, for justice for the most marginalized in the community) are sidelined. This is wearing the skin without the soul: everyone wants to put on the rainbow, but few want to confront why we needed a Pride march in the first place.

In workplaces, aesthetic adoption of DEI looks like polished marketing brochures and corporate statements. The company newsletter declares “We are committed to Diversity, Equity, Inclusion” with glossy photos of smiling employees of every hue. During times of social unrest, perhaps a CEO posts a hashtag in solidarity. Meeting rooms get posters celebrating unity in diversity. And yet, internally, if you scratch the surface, the power hierarchies remain unchanged. The language of inclusion becomes a corporate dialect – every manager learns to say the right words about bias and belonging – but these words often ring hollow. There are companies that have whole teams crafting external messaging about diversity while simultaneously fighting unionization efforts or perpetuating pay gaps and glass ceilings. In fact, many corporations cleverly co-opt DEI language to deflect criticism. For example, some firms, faced with workers organizing for better conditions, will loudly champion their “inclusive culture” as proof workers don’t need unions – a cruel irony noted by activists ￼ ￼. Diversity talk becomes a smokescreen. The aesthetic of diversity – a multicultural Benetton-ad world – is celebrated in advertising, while the boardroom culture remains as it was decades ago. The movement’s terminology itself suffers drift: “equity” and “inclusion” become buzzwords stripped of their connection to civil rights and anti-oppression struggles. In this aesthetic stage, we also see professionalization accelerate. There is now a class of certified diversity experts, HR specialists fluent in saying “the right things.” DEI becomes a career, an industry, with its own conferences and award ceremonies. On the surface, this seems like progress – the ideas are institutionalized and visible. But often the result is that the appearance of progress outpaces the reality. It’s as if the institution says: “If we look like we have solved the problem, maybe people will believe we have.” Aesthetic adoption is a kind of mimicry, like a predator that mimics the colors of a harmless creature. The system dons the trappings of the movement to make it difficult to tell what’s real and what’s for show.

Consider mindfulness as it permeated popular culture in the 2010s. Meditation and yoga imagery became chic. Magazines featured cover stories on the “Mindfulness Revolution” accompanied by stock photos of serene people sitting cross-legged. Celebrities spoke about their meditation routines on late-night talk shows. A certain aura of calm and wisdom became associated with the word “mindful.” Tech companies in Silicon Valley, notoriously high-stress environments, began to brand themselves as mindful workplaces with meditation rooms and slogans like “breathe.” Google, famously, even had an in-house “mindfulness tsar” – an engineer-turned-guru named Chade-Meng Tan – whose actual job title was “Jolly Good Fellow” ￼. He wrote a bestselling book Search Inside Yourself, blending emotional intelligence with meditation tips, and it became part of Google’s internal training. This whimsical appropriation of Buddhist-inspired practice signaled that mindfulness had been fully embraced as part of the corporate aesthetic – something cool, empowering, and innovative to sprinkle on one’s brand. Meanwhile, thousands of mindfulness apps flooded the market, offering calming music, guided meditations, and daily quotes. It became possible to buy mindfulness in a box: just download this app, light this candle, wear this Buddha-bead bracelet, and you’re a mindful person. The aesthetic of mindfulness – peaceful, natural, wise – was a hot commodity. But what of the substance? In many cases, it was exactly as deep as the wallpaper on a meditation app’s home screen. The true practice of mindfulness – which in its traditional context involves rigorous self-examination, ethical living, and community – was often nowhere to be found. As one critic quipped, mindfulness in the West became “McMindfulness,” a fast-food version of spirituality: instantly packaged, easily consumed, but offering little nutrition for the soul ￼. In fact, the term McMindfulness was coined to describe how meditation practices were being served up in a way that provides “immediate nutrition but no long-term sustenance” ￼. All style, little substance. By the time mindfulness became a lifestyle brand, one could go through an entire “mindfulness-based” program without ever hearing words like compassion, liberation, or interdependence – the core values that gave the practice meaning.

In the aesthetic adoption phase, commodification is already well underway (even before the next explicit phase of extraction). The movement’s image is used to sell things – whether that “thing” is a product, a company’s reputation, or a government’s narrative. We see governments too engaging in this: draping themselves in the language of liberation abroad while suppressing it at home, for instance. (One might think of politicians who extol human rights and diversity in speeches but do little to address those issues in practice.) The world of appearances becomes a hall of mirrors. And those who still hold the original vision feel a creeping sense of alienation – the crisis of authenticity is brewing. It is disorienting to see the face of your movement everywhere, yet know that its heart is missing. The elders and originators watch their slogans chanted by people who have no idea of the struggle behind them. It’s like watching a beloved friend turned into a lifeless statue. The aesthetic is there – the hollow idol of what once was sacred – and crowds gather to admire it, forgetting the living spirit it once contained.

## Commercial Extraction: Harvesting the Spirit’s Remains

By the time we reach commercial extraction, the machinery of capitalism is in full gear, mining the movement for profit. If aesthetic adoption was about looking the part, commercial extraction is about making money off it. The movement’s motifs and moderated messages have proven popular enough, so now comes the gold rush. In this phase, every remaining ounce of marketable value is squeezed out of the once-radical idea. The movement’s ethos is not just imitated, but franchised and sold. What was once a freely given insight or a collective struggle becomes a product, a service, a monetized experience. Here, the hollowing reaches completion – the shell is now not only empty but up for sale in the marketplace.

Pride, in many places, has become big business. The LGBTQ+ community’s “sufficient purchasing power, known as pink money,” was noticed by corporations as social acceptance grew ￼. In the early 21st century, every industry wanted a piece of the Pride pie ￼. Pride festivals themselves draw corporate sponsorships in the millions; tourism boards promote Pride Week as a destination event; companies produce limited-edition Pride merchandise (from rainbow beverages to pride-themed apparel) and often mark them up for profit, sometimes donating a token percentage to charity and pocketing the rest. There are LGBTQ+ dating apps sold for fortunes, media companies targeting queer audiences with content – a whole commercial ecosystem riding on what started as a fight for basic rights. This is rainbow capitalism unfiltered: the reality that “the LGBT movement” has been appropriated and profited from as another market segment ￼. An illustrative scene might be a department store in June: racks of T-shirts with slogans like “Yaas Queen” and “Love Wins” for sale, while that same store’s parent company donates to politicians who oppose LGBTQ anti-discrimination laws. The extraction of profit does not care about contradiction – it cares about purchasing power. The history and meaning behind those slogans are irrelevant to the bottom line. In the commercial marketplace, Pride is just a theme, like Halloween or Christmas, that helps move merchandise. And what of those who cannot afford to partake, or who remain marginalized even within the LGBTQ community? They often find Pride events themselves alienating – feeling that without money to spend or a “marketable” identity, Pride isn’t really for them anymore. What was once a community uprising is now a consumer carnival. The movement’s labor of love – decades of activism, tragedy, and triumph – is harvested by people who never broke a sweat for the cause.

In the DEI arena, the phase of commercial extraction has given birth to what some call the “DEI-industrial complex.” In the wake of the 2020 racial justice uprisings and the worldwide focus on equity, DEI suddenly exploded into a multibillion-dollar industry ￼. Consultants, firms, and training programs proliferated at an astonishing rate, selling prepackaged solutions to companies eager to show they were doing something. By 2021, organizations were spending lavishly on one-off diversity workshops, glossy inclusive branding campaigns, and speakers who would come tell inspirational diversity stories at annual meetings ￼. An entire marketplace of expensive, unproductive, and sometimes counterproductive initiatives grew rapidly, often with limited oversight or evidence of impact ￼. DEI had become a product line. Many companies treated it as they would any other outsourced service: pay a fee, get your “diversity certificate” or a series of training modules, and call it a day. The focus shifted to what was easiest to monetize – things like training sessions (which could be repeatedly sold) and PR campaigns – rather than the slow, difficult work of structural change ￼. The consultants largely delivered what the executives wanted to hear and implement, rather than what workers or marginalized communities needed ￼. Thus, the “DEI solutions” often conveniently aligned with maintaining the existing corporate culture (perhaps with a few more diverse faces in the brochure), rather than challenging it. The DEI-industrial complex, in essence, stripped away the social justice core of DEI and stressed talk over action ￼. It told leaders that perception is what counts. One diversity practitioner lamented that this complex has taught many to understand DEI as just that: “All that matters is what we say, not what we do” ￼. Those original ideals – equity, justice, transformation – are sidelined because they are not easily captured in a quarterly report or a purchasable toolkit. Meanwhile, the people who once led anti-racism workshops in church basements and community centers for free now find themselves either priced out by big consulting firms or pressured to join them and tame their message to fit the client’s comfort. Professionalization hits its apex: DEI is a career path, a LinkedIn endorsement, a lucrative speaking circuit. The movement’s energy has been siphoned into profit. And yet, after all the dollars spent, one can ask: have workplaces truly become equitable, or have they just gotten better at marketing themselves? The crisis of authenticity is glaring here – employees often grow cynical, seeing fancy diversity initiatives that change nothing tangible in their day-to-day lives. Indeed, in some cases the commercialization backfires, breeding resentment that the whole thing was a charade.

The story of mindfulness in the commercial extraction phase is perhaps the most astonishing, because it involves monetizing not just a movement or community, but a state of consciousness. What was once taught freely in temples and by volunteer teachers in community centers became a commodity you could buy on the App Store for $9.99 a month. By the late 2010s, the “mindfulness industry” included not just apps (Headspace, Calm, and others valued at billions collectively), but certification programs (you can pay to become a certified mindfulness teacher, often at hefty cost), corporate mindfulness consultants, mindfulness merchandise (coloring books, meditation cushions, aroma oils – even “mindful wine” tasting sessions). Retreat centers and studios popped up to cater to an affluent clientele seeking a weekend of zen. Mindfulness books topped bestseller lists, promising happiness and stress relief if you follow their 10-step plans. The ultimate sign of extraction was when even institutions like the U.S. military and Wall Street adopted mindfulness training – not to foster peace, but to enhance performance. Hedge fund managers took mindfulness courses to gain a mental edge in trading; military programs taught soldiers meditation techniques to improve focus and resiliency under fire ￼. In one chilling example, mindfulness was introduced to help drone pilots reduce stress and avoid burnout while conducting remote killings ￼. Here we see the practice literally inverted: originally a path to cultivate compassion and reduce suffering, now used to make one more effective at activities that arguably create suffering. In the marketplace, however, this was sold as success: “Look how universal mindfulness is! It can help anyone with anything!” The fact that it had been utterly severed from its ethical roots was the price of that success. Scholars Carrette and King noted how mindfulness was being “reduced to merely pacifying feelings of anxiety and disquiet at the individual level, rather than seeking to challenge the social, political and economic inequalities that cause such distress” ￼. In the rush to sell mindfulness as a panacea, its marketers told us that happiness is an inside job – just breathe and accept, and your problems will dissolve. If you’re depressed about working 80-hour weeks, never mind – here’s an app to help you focus and be grateful you have a job ￼. In effect, the commercial mindfulness boom often served to deflect attention from systemic problems, exactly as the masters of the system would wish ￼ ￼. Slavoj Žižek cynically quipped that mindfulness had become the “hegemonic ideology of global capitalism,” allowing people to participate fully in the capitalist frenzy while maintaining the appearance of sanity ￼ ￼. It is a biting observation: the very practice meant to wake people up is being used to keep them asleep within the comfortable dream of the status quo. We have reached the point where the commodification is so complete that the original context is almost unrecognizable. Mindfulness sold as just another self-improvement product affirms the individualistic narrative (“your suffering is your own doing and you can fix it by yourself”), which perfectly fits a consumer society’s ethos. Thus the market-driven extraction of the mindfulness movement’s benefits ends up reinforcing the conditions that cause distress in the first place – a perfect ouroboros of co-option.

By now, the pattern is clear and the cost stark: liberation movements, once living and breathing attempts to remake our world, end up as hollow brands. The fire is gone; only the logo remains. The people have been pacified into consumers. The radical teachings have been neutralized into soundbites. What was communal becomes individual; what was justice becomes jargon; what was sacred becomes saleable. It is here we stand at a precipice – the crisis of authenticity can no longer be ignored.

## Institutional Incorporation: The Caged Bird Sings on Cue

The final phase, institutional incorporation, is in some ways the culmination of all previous ones. It is when the movement, now hollowed of its subversive vitality, is fully absorbed into the official structures of society. The movement (or what’s left of it) is now inside the belly of the beast, living as a controlled, domesticated thing. It has a seat at the table – perhaps even its own office – but it no longer flips the table over. It is the caged bird that might still sing, but only on cue and within the confines of its cage. The institutions – governments, corporations, schools, religious bodies – declare victory: the movement has been “addressed” and “included.” For those in power, this is ideal: the solution is tidy, and the problem can be considered solved, while real power dynamics remain largely intact. For the movement’s original spirit, this stage is suffocating – yet not entirely without ambiguous hope.

What does institutional incorporation look like? In the case of Pride and LGBTQ+ rights, one could point to laws and policies changing (which is a genuine success of activism, to be clear) but also how those changes can lead to a premature sense of “mission accomplished.” For instance, once gay marriage became legal in many countries, a lot of people – especially those outside the community – assumed the struggle was basically over. Pride celebrations in many cities transformed from protest marches into city-sanctioned events with permits, police cordons, and politicians at the front of the line. City halls raise the rainbow flag for a day. Big businesses now have internal LGBTQ affinity groups and Pride receptions, which is certainly a positive step for employees. But these incorporations also mean Pride has been domesticated into an institutional routine. The radical chants about queer liberation have been replaced by carefully worded slogans vetted by PR departments. Even the police – the very force once raiding gay bars – now want to march in Pride parades to show their openness (a move that itself has sparked debates and pushback from activists who remember that history). The movement has been invited inside the castle, but on the castle’s terms. And as long as one is inside, shouting too loudly or bringing up discomforting issues (like the disproportionate struggles of queer people of color, or trans homelessness, or the violence of the criminal justice system) might get you politely shushed: We don’t do that here; we’ve already solved that, haven’t we? The institutional memory becomes selective. Stonewall’s riot becomes a polite tale of progress taught in company diversity trainings, stripped of its anger. The once-subversive idea that sexuality and gender variance could upend patriarchy and family norms is replaced with an image of happy assimilated gay couples living the suburban dream. The movement lives on, but now within boundaries. It has non-profits, task forces, government liaisons. It is part of The System – which means The System assumes ownership of it.

For DEI, institutional incorporation is epitomized by the creation of permanent departments and roles in organizations. Almost every university, and many companies, now has an Office of Diversity and Inclusion or a Chief Diversity Officer. These roles and units, in theory, represent the movement’s ideals having carved out a space within institutions of power. They often do good and necessary work. Yet they also face a dilemma: being inside the system means they are often constrained by the system’s logic. Many diversity officers find themselves isolated, under-resourced, or sidelined when they propose anything that goes beyond cosmetic changes. The institution, by incorporating DEI, sends the message “We have this handled,” which can actually blunt external pressure. Activists are told, “Don’t protest, talk to the DEI office.” But if that DEI office itself has little authority beyond advising and holding events, the incorporation can function as a stalling mechanism. It’s a way to channel dissent into bureaucracy. We see this in universities where student demands for racial justice are funneled into committee meetings and years-long “climate surveys” rather than immediate action. We see it in corporations that hire a Black woman as Chief Diversity Officer and then do not listen to her when she points out pay inequities – but they will showcase her at every opportunity as evidence of their enlightenment. Furthermore, as DEI became part of institutions, it ironically became a target in political culture wars. In recent years, some conservative politicians have attacked the presence of DEI programs in public institutions, accusing them of being wasteful or biased. Laws have even been passed in some states to ban public funding for DEI activities in schools and colleges ￼. This means that the movement, once outside throwing rocks, is now a formal part of the institution enough to be legislated against. The cage is rattled from both inside and out. Inside, it must not offend its host; outside, it is attacked by those who resent its very presence. The result is often a further watering down – DEI programs stick to benign territory to avoid controversy and justify their existence. The adaptation becomes almost complete capitulation: “We will talk about inclusion in food diversity in the cafeteria, but not about hiring practices that might spark legal or political pushback.” The institutionalized movement, in its caution, can lose the trust of the very people it was meant to serve (marginalized employees or students), who now see it as just part of HR, not a voice for true change.

And mindfulness – how does a practice incorporate institutionally? We see it in hospitals, clinics, militaries, schools, prisons. Mindfulness programs and curricula have been absorbed into these systems to the point that they are routine. Doctors refer patients to mindfulness meditation for anxiety; schools incorporate a few minutes of breathing exercises for restless kids; the Department of Defense funds resilience training with mindfulness components for soldiers. The practice has entered the bureaucracy. On one hand, this is a testament to its adaptability and efficacy – there is recognition that it can help people in tangible ways. On the other hand, within these institutions mindfulness is often treated as a neutral technique, deliberately stripped of the moral and philosophical framework that once made it transformative. The institution isn’t interested in becoming Buddhist or questioning its own purpose; it just wants a tool to make its charges a bit healthier or more compliant. So mindfulness classes in a prison might help individual inmates cope with stress, but they won’t address the injustices of mass incarceration. Soldiers might learn breath control to steady themselves, but nothing in their training encourages them to see the humanity of those on the other side of their weapons. The context is isolated – mindfulness becomes context-less mental exercise. We arrive at what some critics call “mindfulness-based mind control,” where the practice is used to shape people to better fit into existing systems rather than to question or change them ￼ ￼. The once-liberating insight that we can find peace and clarity becomes an injunction to adjust your attitude in whatever conditions you find yourself. Institutional incorporation means mindfulness is now an expected part of certain programs – and once something is expected and institutional, it often loses its spark of inspiration. It’s no longer a discovery; it’s a requirement. Imagine a future where a boss says, “We noticed you’re stressed; please attend the mandatory mindfulness session. That should fix it.” The subtext: if you’re still unhappy, it’s your own fault for not being mindful enough. Such a scenario places the onus fully on the individual, absolving the institution of responsibility – exactly what a co-opted spiritual practice would do in service of power. The language of mindfulness, once countercultural, becomes bureaucratic. We might even foresee a kind of institutional jargon around it: employees coached to use “I statements” and practice “mindful listening,” not because it’s heartfelt, but because that’s company policy for meetings. The cage of institutionalization is subtle here – it makes something beautiful into a checkbox.

At this point in the pattern, the crisis of authenticity bursts into full view. The world looks and sees that all these movements – once fresh sources of energy and change – are apparently alive and present in our institutions. Pride is an official month; DEI is a department; mindfulness is an accepted health intervention. But something feels off. Why, despite all this, do the deeper problems persist or even worsen? Why do many LGBTQ+ folks still feel marginalized? Why do workplaces still struggle with racism and sexism? Why are stress and anxiety at epidemic levels even as meditation studios thrive? People begin to ask: Was it all for nothing? Or perhaps they conclude cynically: All of this was a sham; there’s no real substance to these “movements” after all. That cynicism is the final triumph of co-option – when the broader public can no longer tell the difference between the authentic movement that once was and the hollowed one that exists now. The reputation of the cause itself can suffer. We see backlash: “Pride has become a circus, it’s lost its dignity.” “DEI is just political correctness or corporate virtue signaling – it doesn’t actually help anyone.” “Mindfulness is snake oil, a trendy fad for yuppies.” These dismissals, though unfair to the original intentions, gain traction because indeed the prominent examples of each are easy targets: rainbow capitalism, the DEI-industrial complex, McMindfulness – all deserving of critique.

This is the bleak picture of a movement fully co-opted: not only has it been defanged, but the very notion of it is now met with a weary roll of the eyes. The liberation movement’s name may remain, but it now means something very different in the culture than it did at birth. The language drift is nearly complete. Words that meant empowerment now trigger skepticism or ambivalence. The living movement appears dead.

## The Crisis of Authenticity and the Flicker of Alive Movements

Here we stand, amid the echoing halls of co-option, feeling the weight of this hollowing. It is a crisis of authenticity. How do we know what’s real anymore? When every slogan can be mimicked, every virtue commodified, how do we trust the next movement that arises? How do we even trust ourselves, as participants in systems that are hostile to life? If you, dear reader, feel this cynicism or confusion, know that it is a reasonable response. We have all been witness to the life cycle described above – perhaps multiple times in our lives. The pattern is recursive; it doesn’t happen just once. As one movement is absorbed, another sprouts at the margins and the dance begins again. Indeed, look closely: even now, new seeds of liberation are germinating in unexpected places. They carry different names – perhaps climate justice, or abolition, or decolonization – and many will face similar attempts at co-option. Yet the story is not over. Authenticity is a wily, resilient force. It has a way of slipping through the bars of every cage, of outwitting every predator that wants to devour it. To remain alive within hostile systems, individuals and communities have long developed adaptive, even subversive strategies. This chapter would not be complete without honoring those strategies and shining a light on the possibility of renewal.

First, let us remember: the soul of a liberation movement is not a brand or a slogan – it is a living relationship between people, grounded in shared values and experiences. That living heart often goes underground during co-option. When the mainstream takes over the surface, the authentic movement may retreat to the shadows for a time, keeping the flame alive in smaller, truer circles. Think of how, even as corporate Pride dominates the headlines, there are grassroots groups organizing alternative pride marches with no sponsors, explicitly returning Pride to its protest roots. In New York City, for example, the Reclaim Pride coalition has organized the “Queer Liberation March,” no floats, no corporations – a deliberate throwback to community and activism. These efforts often get less attention, but they are crucial sanctuaries for authenticity. They say, in effect, we will still gather and speak our truth, even if the world thinks Pride is just a party. Similarly, within the workplace context, while official DEI might be floundering, worker-led movements for justice have risen. The very failure of superficial DEI gave birth to newfound energy in unions and worker collectives to tackle issues like racism and sexism on their own terms. Employees form affinity groups that actually hold management accountable, or they organize walkouts and petitions that speak in plain language (not corporate PR) about what needs to change. These actions often happen outside the official DEI channels, or in creative tension with them. For example, when tech companies touted their diversity stats but continued contracts with oppressive government agencies, employees themselves organized protests and leaked information, forcing a reckoning that no polite internal memo could achieve. In the spiritual realm, while mindfulness became a buzzword, many seekers dug deeper to find the roots of the practice. They discovered teachers and communities that emphasize the full path – ethics, wisdom, and compassion, not just meditation for stress relief. There is a growing movement of “socially engaged Buddhism” and decolonizing mindfulness – practitioners reconnecting mindfulness to social action and to its Asian lineages, refusing to let it be just a commercial good. These people often practice within the margins of the wellness industry, not its glitzy center. They form sanghas focused on racial justice or climate activism, bringing meditation into direct conversation with the world’s pain. They keep the practice contextualized, whole, and thus keep it alive as a force for true change in self and society.

What these examples show is a pattern of resistance from within. Life is cunning: when one path is blocked, it finds another. The co-optation process is never perfect, never total. There are always cracks in the edifice where the light of authenticity shines through. As the system tries to seal every crack, life makes new ones. Consider language – co-option often works by diluting language, but authenticity can respond by creating new language. Activists coin new terms once old ones are co-opted. “Diversity” becomes empty? Communities start talking about “equity” or “anti-racism” or “belonging” or “liberation” again. And when those get co-opted, new phrases will arise (we see this already with terms like “decolonizing” entering mainstream, to the chagrin of those who’d like to contain it). The dance of words continues. It’s important to note that these new terms often come from those most impacted – the ones whose needs were not met by the hollow reforms. They inject fresh meaning that can’t easily be mimicked because it’s too raw… at least until it too gains power.

Another strategy is professional radicalism with a foot in each world. Some individuals choose to occupy roles in institutions (like a Diversity Officer, or a mindfulness program leader, or even a marketing person during Pride campaigns) with the intention of subtly subverting from within. They speak the institutional language outwardly to survive, but quietly, they nurture real change behind the scenes. This requires spiritual fortitude – to not lose oneself in the act. It’s akin to a double-agent or what spiritual traditions might call being “in the world but not of the world.” A mindful example: there are therapists who offer the clinically accepted mindfulness courses in hospitals to get funding, but in their delivery of it, they gently introduce deeper concepts of compassion and community, re-infusing what was stripped away, but in a stealthy manner. Or a corporate DEI trainer might fulfill the contractually obligated lecture on unconscious bias, but also slip in stories of structural inequality and encourage employees to form caucuses to support each other beyond the training – planting seeds that might grow later. These insiders often network with each other, sharing tips on how to work quietly within the beast without being digested. They keep each other’s authenticity alive through solidarity, even if externally they appear as part of the machine.

Yet another approach to remaining alive is to emphasize the relational and contextual nature of these practices and movements at every turn. Vivarism, with its relational, adaptive lens, suggests that nothing truly alive can be separated from its ecosystem without harm. Thus, one antidote to hollowing is to relentlessly put things back in context. If mindfulness is taught, tie it back to ethical action and community every time. If Pride is celebrated, tie it back to the continuing struggles of queer folks and link arms with other liberation struggles (remembering that Pride emerged linked with anti-racist and anti-capitalist movements). If DEI is implemented, tie it to real outcomes and to the voices of the marginalized, constantly refocusing on why it exists – to fulfill the unrealized promises of justice and opportunity. This contextualizing work is a form of education as resistance. It fights the narrative that “we have arrived” and keeps reminding everyone that the journey is ongoing and requires sincerity.

Ultimately, remaining alive within hostile systems also calls for a kind of spiritual resilience. This is where the manifesto tone may turn inward: How is your heart as you navigate these co-opted landscapes? It is easy to become jaded or to burn out in anger. The system often co-opts not just movements but our very emotions, turning passion into fatigue, hope into despair. To stay alive, one must cultivate an inner freedom that the system cannot touch – a connection to the original source of the movement’s inspiration. In Vivarist philosophy, this might be seen as staying connected to life’s self-recursive, adaptive intelligence. It means embodying the change in our own being so authentically that even if the external forms are hijacked, the essence continues through us. If you practice mindfulness, truly practice it – let it wake you up to injustices and interdependence, not lull you into complacency. If you celebrate Pride, do it with knowledge of its history and extend your celebration to advocacy for those not yet free. If you work in DEI, use your position to listen radically to those unheard and channel their truth upward, even if softly.

We must also be willing to let go and let die the hollow forms when their time has passed. One of the hardest parts of this journey is mourning the loss of what a movement used to be, and moving on to what it needs to be next. The husk can be so beloved – institutions will fight to preserve the husk because it’s convenient. But sometimes the most liberating act is to say: Pride, as organized by these institutions, is no longer serving liberation; let’s create something new. Or: if “mindfulness” is now too co-opted a term, perhaps we speak of “presence” or “awakening” or find new practices that achieve the same goal without the baggage. The life force is not in the label; it’s in the intent and action. There is a spiritual lesson of impermanence here: forms change, essence remains if we carry it.

In the end, perhaps we can look at co-option with different eyes – not as a static tragedy, but as part of a dynamic evolutionary process between life and the systems that life creates. The very fact that systems try so hard to co-opt liberation movements is a testament to the power those movements hold. Power wants that energy because it’s potent. So potent that, ironically, even in consumption, some of it escapes. Like a predator eating a poisoned prey and unwittingly ingesting a toxin, the system can choke on a movement it tried to swallow whole. You see this when an attempted co-option backfires – when companies overdo the rainbow capitalism and face consumer backlash, or when a superficial diversity move triggers employees to demand more and unionize, or when introducing mindfulness exposes people to deeper questions about their lives and they start challenging their work conditions. Co-option is not the end of the story; it is an ongoing dialectic. The hollowing can itself be hollow – an emptiness that eventually collapses.

So, the question “how can individuals and movements remain alive within hostile systems?” can be answered with a metaphor of fire and seeds. A movement is a fire: when it burns bright, the system tries to contain it, smother it, or put it behind glass. But from that fire many tiny sparks – seeds of light – can fly out and land in fertile soil elsewhere. Each co-optation generates new dissenters, new creativity at the margins. Our task is to notice those sparks and nurture them. To be alive is to be in constant relationship, adapting and rebelling and creating.

We must cultivate a vigilant awareness: noticing when our language is drifting, when our purpose is being professionalized into something else, when context is being stripped, when commodification is creeping in. By noticing, we can respond early – reanchor ourselves in truth, bring in marginalized voices, refresh the vision, refuse the bribe of selective engagement when it asks us to compromise too much.

And we must support each other in authenticity. A living system – say a forest – survives because of the network of support: the trees share nutrients underground through mycorrhizal networks, warning of pests and feeding saplings in the shade. Likewise, those committed to the soul of a movement should form networks that share information and strength beneath the surface. Mentors who have seen a cycle before can warn the new generation (“Watch out, this is how they will try to buy you off”). Communities can hold space for grief when co-option happens, so that disappointment doesn’t turn to disengagement but rather to wisdom.

Lastly, there is something spiritually subversive in maintaining joy and creativity even in the face of these forces. Co-option is a force of death-in-life – it creates zombies of movements. To counter it, we affirm life-in-death – finding vitality even in what the system thought it had killed. Laugh, dance, and play at the absurdity of how they try to package liberation. Use humor and art to reveal the emptiness of the hollow forms. Satire can be powerful: when activists lampoon corporate pride or “mindful massacres,” they expose the truth sharply. This trickster energy is very much in line with Vivarism’s adaptive playfulness – outsmart the system by refusing to lose your humanity.

In closing, let us recall that the word “co-opt” itself has roots meaning “to choose, to take as one’s own.” The hostile system chooses the movement and takes it as its own. But what is truly one’s own cannot be taken by another. The inner freedom, the true aliveness of a movement, belongs always to those who embody it. The system can take the name, the symbols, even the institutions – but the beating heart, if we safeguard it, will always slip away from its grasp at the last moment and reappear elsewhere, unexpected, reborn. Like a phoenix from ashes or a seed from the droppings of a bird that ate the fruit, the essence finds new life.

This chapter has been a warning, a eulogy, and an invocation. We warn of how every liberation can be hollowed. We mourn what has been lost – the purity of purpose eroded, the comrades co-opted, the words twisted. But we also invoke the spirit of life that underpins liberation. We speak as one living system to another: Stay awake. Adapt. Be as serpents and as doves. Recognize the pattern, then lovingly break it, again and again. In doing so, we honor the truth that liberation was never a one-time victory to be won, but a living, breathing practice – a way of being that must be nurtured in each moment, against all odds, in a world that will forever seek to tame it.

The hollowing of movements is real, but so is the hallowing of movements – the sacred endurance of their core. As long as people seek to truly be free and to free each other, that core will never die. It will only exchange forms, moving through history’s cycles, whispering to those with ears to hear: protect me, carry me, I am still alive. And so we shall.
