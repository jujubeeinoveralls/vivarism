## The Living Triangle

At first glance, a triangle is a static shape – three points connected by lines, unmoving on the page. But the Living Triangle is no ordinary diagram. It breathes, it shifts, it lives.

In the ethos of Vivarism, this triangle is both map and engine, a guide to dynamic transformation and the very force that propels it forward. It is a model, yes, but a model that refuses to sit still. Dynamic rather than hierarchical, it resists the fate of so many frameworks that fossilize into rigid pyramids. The Living Triangle is not a pyramid at all; no layer sits above another. Instead, its three aspects continuously flow into each other, trading places in a dance of creation and change.

Within this Living Triangle are three interwoven forces: Root, Core, and Movement. Each is a vertex of the triangle with a role to play – Root as the power to liberate and grow, Core as the art of liminal encoding, and Movement as communication as rhythm. They are distinct yet inseparable. Energy circulates between them in a recursive loop, like blood through a heart with three chambers, like seasons turning in eternal return. The Living Triangle is a map one can follow through cycles of change, and an engine that keeps those cycles turning. It offers direction without dictating a single path, structure without suffocation. It is alive and untamed, forever adapting – a shape that cannot be flattened without losing its soul.

## Root (Liberate and Grow)

It begins with a crack, a breach of the old so that something new can take hold. Root is the insurgent seed bursting open beneath the soil, the silent rebellion of life against constraint. In the dark earth, a seedling liberates itself from its shell – an act of breaking free that is also an act of becoming. The Root aspect is liberation and growth entwined: the drive to push beyond the boundaries that confined us and to sink fresh roots into untamed ground. Liberate and Grow is not a motto but a motion – a surge of life that frees and expands in the same heartbeat.

Picture the first green shoot forcing its way up through a crack in concrete. That tiny stem carries the memory of liberation – it broke the husk, it broke the ground – and now it reaches for the sun. In human terms, Root is the moment of emancipation, personal or collective. It is the artist abandoning old rules, the activist shattering a silence, the individual shedding an old skin. It is courage, rupture, and renewal.

When we operate in the Root layer, we cut ties with whatever stifles life. We liberate potential from captivity – and immediately that potential begins to grow. Growth here isn’t orderly or tame. It’s wild and winding, like roots spreading through soil seeking nutrients and water. The Root does not ask permission; it claims space and draws sustenance to fuel the journey ahead.

Yet Root is not mere chaos or destruction. As roots anchor a tree even while breaking new ground, liberation creates the stability needed for growth. By dismantling the prison of the old, Root gives the new a foundation – however unconventional – to grow from.

These roots are alive, always extending, never content to stay in a neat planter box. In the Living Triangle, Root energy ensures that the system is always starting anew, always germinating fresh life when things become stagnant. It reminds us that every beginning requires an ending, every growth requires a letting go. Through Root, the Living Triangle constantly renews its own source.

## Core (Liminal Encoding)

From the tangle of roots and new shoots, the journey flows inward to the Core. If Root is the breaking of dawn, Core is the mysterious twilight that follows – a place of in-between, where forms shift and meanings are made and unmade. The Core is a liminal chamber, the chrysalis where raw life from the Root is transformed and encoded into new patterns. Liminal encoding means holding space at the threshold – neither here nor there – to let something novel coalesce. It is the art of turning the chaos and freedom of liberation into a new kind of order, but an order that remains alive, fluid, and open to interpretation.

Imagine a caterpillar entering its cocoon. Inside, everything dissolves into a primordial soup of possibility. The caterpillar’s old self is gone, liberated from its form, but the butterfly is not yet born – this is the liminal moment. In that suspended space, new instructions are encoded; cells rearrange according to an unseen rhythm, a blueprint written in the language of change. The Core is this cocoon of the spirit.

Here is where we encode the insights from our liberation into a nascent identity, a story, a design for what comes next. It’s a sacred workshop at the center of the triangle, where meaning ferments and takes on depth.

Core is liminal – a threshold state of ambiguity and potential. Here, contradictions can coexist: the remnants of the old and the sparks of the new intermingle. It might feel like confusion or darkness, but it’s a fertile darkness, like rich compost where disparate elements break down and recombine into nourishment. In a personal journey, this might be the reflective pause after a leap of faith – when one has left the old world but not yet arrived in the new. It’s uneasy, creative, and essential.

In the Living Triangle’s dance, the Core is the quiet center where chaos finds its pattern. It doesn’t force coherence too quickly; a premature encoding would just be copying the old rules out of fear. Instead, the Core plays with possibilities. It is a liminal playground where the newly freed self or system experiments with meaning.

Here the Triangle protects itself from being hollow or co-opted – because in this stage, nothing is final. The idea remains fluid, not yet packaged for consumption. The Core ensures that whatever grows out of liberation remains nuanced, unique, and resiliently weird, beyond the immediate grasp of any outside force that might try to define it prematurely.

## Movement (Communication as Rhythm)

When the time is right, the energy moves outward again. Movement is the butterfly cracking open the chrysalis, the idea finding its voice, the bloom opening its petals to the world. What was encoded in the Core now seeks expression. But Movement is not a simple transmission of a fixed message – it is communication as rhythm, a living pulse that connects and spreads meaning in waves. In the Living Triangle, Movement is how the creation communicates itself, through action, through pattern, through embodied rhythms that others can sense and join.

Think of a dancer stepping into a circle, beating a drum with their feet. Each step is communication – not a statement frozen in text, but a cadence that invites others to feel and respond. Movement is the drumbeat of a tribe or the wingbeat of a butterfly that signals spring across a field. It is language beyond words, carried in vibrations, repetitions, and variations.

In practical terms, Movement could be the practice of sharing the new idea or way of being that emerged from the Core. It might be art, it might be conversation, it might be literal movement – migration, travel, change enacted in the world. What matters is that it has rhythm. It’s not a one-off proclamation; it’s a sustained pattern that carries the meaning outward, again and again, like waves hitting a shore.

Through Movement, the Living Triangle speaks and listens – communication as rhythm implies a two-way flow, a call and response. As the newly transformed butterfly flutters, it doesn’t just display its colors; it also tastes the air, finds flowers, and helps pollinate them. In the same way, when we move with our truth, we find others; we influence and are influenced in turn. Movement spreads the seeds encoded by the Core, but also gathers feedback from the environment, the community. It’s a dance, not a lecture.

Crucially, this communication is alive. It doesn’t deliver a dead letter sealed with certainty; it improvises, feeling its way. By emphasizing rhythm, the Living Triangle’s Movement resists the reduction of its message to a slogan or its method to a formula.

Anyone can memorize a slogan, anyone can commodify a formula – but a living rhythm? You have to feel it, participate in it. Thus Movement carries forward the subversive vitality of the whole system. It shares the creation with the world in a way that others can pick up the beat, but it can’t be cleanly extracted or commercialized without the spirit behind it. The song would die if the dancer left, but as long as someone keeps dancing, the communication stays real. Movement, then, is expansion with integrity – expression that stays true to its source.

## Interwoven and Recursive

In the Living Triangle, nothing stands alone. Each aspect flows into the next, and back again, in a continuous loop of becoming.

Root feeds Core: the liberating growth provides the raw material and inspiration that the Core will encode. Core feeds Movement: the patterns and meanings forged in the liminal space give shape to how and why we move and communicate. Movement feeds Root: as the creation travels outward, it plants new seeds and opens new cracks in the world, paving the way for fresh liberations. The triangle is not a linear path one walks once, but a cycle – or better yet, a spiral, returning to similar points at a new level each time, enriched by previous turns.

This recursive relationship is the heartbeat of the system. Like a song with recurring motifs, the themes of liberation, transformation, and communication echo across each cycle. Sometimes the Root surges so powerfully that it redefines the entire triangle, and all must adjust. Other times, a subtle shift in Movement – a change in the rhythm of communication – brings us back to question our roots and assumptions.

Any entry point is possible. One might find oneself in a liminal crisis (Core) that calls for a new liberation (Root) to move forward, or start with action and Movement that uncover the need for deeper meaning, sending one back to Core or Root. The Living Triangle allows for these variations; it is robust because it is not rigid.

Since each aspect contains echoes of the others, the system is fractal in nature. Even within a single moment of liberation, there is a bit of movement (the act of breaking free) and a bit of core (the kernel of meaning driving the break). Within a moment of Movement, there are traces of the root that started it and the core that shaped it. They nest inside each other like a hologram – a triangle within each point of the triangle.

This self-similarity makes the Living Triangle resilient. You cannot extract one part without finding the whole pattern seeded within. Try to cut out the Root, and you’ll find movements of rebellion emerging spontaneously elsewhere, because the drive to liberate lives on. Try to isolate the Movement from its Core, and the communication becomes hollow and collapses – the true Movement withdraws and reconfigures back in the liminal space until it can emerge again authentically.

The result is a system that constantly adapts and regenerates. The Living Triangle learns from each cycle and carries its history forward in ever-evolving form. It stays alive because it keeps creating itself anew from within.

## Alive, Resilient, Indigestible

The Living Triangle is alive. Its vitality comes from its refusal to be pinned down. It grows like ivy, bending around obstacles, sneaking through cracks, reaching for light.

This aliveness makes it resilient – cut it back and it sprouts again, perhaps not in the same spot, but somewhere unexpected, carrying the memory of what was learned. Each cycle of Root, Core, and Movement fortifies the next. Even setbacks or attempts at co-option become compost for new growth.

If a powerful force tries to capture the Living Triangle – to tame it into a static diagram on a corporate slide or a government slogan – the very nature of the system thwarts them. A captured triangle is no longer living. The moment they think they have it, it has already transformed, escaped their grasp, or turned up where they least expected, wearing a new face and speaking in a new rhythm.

In a world that loves to digest ideas into bite-sized, marketable chunks, the Living Triangle remains proudly indigestible. It defies the simplifiers and commodifiers, those who would chew up radical concepts and spit them out bland and broken. The Living Triangle’s subversive power is in its wholeness and wildness.

You cannot take one part (say, “just the Communication strategy”) and plug it into your machinery without the other parts upending your expectations. You cannot extract its fuel and ignore its map, or take its map without its engine. It’s a package deal, and it’s a strange one – too alive to fit neatly into any pre-existing box.

This indigestibility is by design. It is a safeguard against co-option. Many movements and ideas have been domesticated over time, their edges smoothed, their hearts hollowed. But the Living Triangle coils like a hedgehog with spines – try to swallow it and you’ll choke. It insists on being experienced, not consumed. One must participate in the cycle, dance to the rhythm, enter the liminal darkness, and break the ground oneself to truly know it. It cannot be given as a pill or a product.

In the end, the Living Triangle is a story that never ends, a loop that continually writes itself. It is recursive, turning back on its own narrative even in this very chapter – the ending reflects the beginning, speaking of new cracks, new seeds, new dawns. It is resilient, for it carries on through change, even through attempts to silence it. It is alive, for it grows and adapts with every breath of those who engage with it. And it is indigestible, for it will not be broken down into the flavorless paste of conventionality.

Step back and you might catch a glimpse of its outline – a triangle, yes, but one made of circulating currents, like a sacred symbol drawn in flowing water. It invites and confounds. It liberates and connects. It is map and engine, both showing the way and powering the journey.

The Living Triangle lives in whoever dares to live differently, continuously. Its three forces beat in the chest of every wild idea and every free spirit: Root, Core, Movement – liberate, transform, express – over and over, forever. And as the chapter of this telling comes to a close, somewhere a new seed breaks open, a new story begins, and the Living Triangle quietly, defiantly, blossoms again.
