## Phase 1: FOUNDATION
This is your root system. If it’s clear, everything else will feel inevitable instead of arbitrary. If it’s mushy? You’re just writing very pretty nonsense.

1. [[The Context (The Wound)]]
	* This is the why—the emotional and historical rupture that makes Vivarism necessary.
	* Don’t just describe the wound. Let the reader feel it. Make them squirm.
	* Without this, everything else sounds like fancy self-help or a cult with better graphic design.
2. [[The Seed (What is Vivarism?)]]
	- This is the what—the beating heart of the idea.
	- Avoid making it feel like a static manifesto. Make it squirmy, strange, alive.
	- Root it in paradox: openness and structure, flexibility and clarity.
	- Trojan seeding is a core genius mechanic. Expand that sucker like it’s a biological strategy.
3. [[The Living Triangle (How It Moves)]]
	* This is the how—your internal logic system.
	* It can’t just sound cool. It has to work across contexts (spiritual, technological, relational).
	* Make sure each layer is clear, distinct, and recursive. They need to feed each other.
	* Show it in motion. Systems diagrams are fine, but metaphors are better.

## Phase 2: EXPANSION
Once your holy trinity is strong enough to walk around on its own:

1. [[The Body (Allegories and Metaphors)]]
	* These should reveal principles from the triangle.
	* Each image should map to a concept you’ve introduced.
	* Think of them like spiritual mnemonics: they make the system stick in the nervous system.
2. [[Healing The Wound]]
	* Apply the framework to internal systems (trauma, nervous system stuff, group dynamics).
	* Show how it avoids guru/therapy traps.
	* Don’t preach healing. Show how Vivarism creates conditions for it.
3. [[The Practice]]
	* Give tactile, rhythmic behaviors.
	* Let the rituals feel inevitable, not bolted on.
	* Remember: practice is how ideas grow legs. If it can’t be lived, it’s just Pinterest theology.
4. [[The Design]]
	* This is where you prove that your idea survives the real world.
	* Show how it applies to code, institutions, AI, communities, governance, etc.
	* Show how it handles misuse, collapse, and theft—and why it keeps growing anyway.
